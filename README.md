# 2023 IEEE Cybermatics Congress



The 2023 IEEE Cybermatics Congress is held in Ocean Flower Island, Hainan, China, December 17-21, 2023. Advances in computers, information and networks is bringing a digital cyber world to our daily lives. Numerous digital things or cyber entities are generated and will reside in the cyber world. Meanwhile, countless real things in the conventional physical, social and mental worlds will possess cyber mappings or cyber components, to have a cyber existence in cyber world. Cyberization is an emerging trend forming the new cyber world and reforming conventional worlds towards cyber-enabled hyper worlds. Cybermatics is to build systematic knowledge about new phenomena, behaviors, properties and practices in the cyberspace, cyberization and cyber-enabled hyper worlds. Cybermatics is characterized by not only catching up with the human intelligence (e.g. intelligent sensing, making decision and control, etc), but also learn from the nature-inspired attributes (e.g., dynamics, self-adaptability, energy saving).

The IEEE Cybermatics Congress originated from the 2013 World Cybermatics Congress (Beijing, China). Cybermatics 2023 is the continuation after the success of Cybermatics 2022 in Finland, Cybermatics 2021 in Australia, Cybermatics 2020 in Greece, Cybermatics 2019 in Atlanta, Cybermatics 2018 in Halifax, Cybermatics 2017 in Exeter, Cybermatics 2016 in Chengdu, Cybermatics 2015 in Sydney, and Cybermatics 2014 in Taipei. IEEE Cybermatics 2023 aims to provide a high-profile platform for researchers and engineers to exchange and explore state-of-art innovations in cyber technology and their applications in physical, social and mental worlds.
